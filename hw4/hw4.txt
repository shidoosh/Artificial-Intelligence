Is graph1 satisfiable with 3 colors? 
	No. 

What about with 4 colors? 
	Yes. 

What do these instances tell you about the graph coloring problem of the above graph? 
	Because the node with the highest degree is 4, it is not solvable with only 3 colors, but it is with 4 colors. 

Can you give a solution (a coloring) to the graph coloring problem of the above graph based on the results of RSat?
	One solution:
		Node 1: yellow
		Node 2: blue
		Node 3: green
		Node 4: blue
		Node 5: red
		Node 6: green
		Node 7: red

What is the minimum number of colors required to properly color graph2?
	8.
